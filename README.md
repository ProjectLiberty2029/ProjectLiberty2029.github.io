# ProjectLiberty2029.github.io
Here you will find a blueprint for restoring the foundations of Liberty and Justice, and for dedicating ourselves to the proposition that a Nation so founded shall not perish from this earth.

We hope you will join us in three main tasks with this material:

. Strengthen these reforms by improving the documents here.  We want this framework to become the most competent and comprehensive possible blueprint for a freer and more secure life for all Americans. Its mandate must also include restoring Fairness and Justice as the principle of governance in America and, by our example of renewed commitment to it, to the World. 
. Communicate the main points of this project as widely as possible. This will invite iterations for improving these proposals further. 
. Recruit leaders to push for these proposals as defining issues of the 2026 and 2028 elections.
