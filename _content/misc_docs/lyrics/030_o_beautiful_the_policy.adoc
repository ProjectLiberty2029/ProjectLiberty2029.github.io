O beautiful, for spacious skies, +
For amber waves of grain. +
For purple mountain majesties +
Above the fruited plain. +
America! America! +
Enlightenment for thee +
Means add a good now understood +
To corporate policy. 

O beautiful, to build assets +
And spread the pool of risk +
The corporate structure is the best. +
But thereâ€™s an asterisk. +
America! America! +
You started with this greed +
To maximize a few mens' rise +
And now a change you need. +

O beautiful, to see the change, +
A single word is all. +
From Shareholder you rearrange +
And Stakeholder install. +
America! America! +
Shared values rise away +
For maximize means all will rise +
And birth a brand new day. 

O beautiful, to now be free +
from having people train +
In corporate greed pathology +
And live in moral stain. +
America! America! +
Let true Grace fall on thee. +
And crown this good with brotherhood +
From sea to shining sea.
