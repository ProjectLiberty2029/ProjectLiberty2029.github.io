== Overview

US Code is divided into "Titles."

Title 26 is the US Tax Code, and is generally known as "The Internal Revenue Code." 

The last substantial reform of The Internal Revenue Code was during the Reagan administration, and the code has also been known by the name "Internal Revenue Code of 1986" ever since then. 

It is past time to rename and reform taxes again. 

This is a bill that will do that. 

== Notes on Bill language

Bills have two kinds of language in them: 

. The Operating Language
. The Law that is left. 

For example, consider if a bill said the following: 

_Amend Section 23 to change the phrase "shall be null" to_ "shall be void."

The part that is italicized is the "operational language" which is used to: 

* Give helpful organizing information like a table of contents and a working title to the Bill. 
* Direct lawyers and law writers and bureaucrats who will implement the Bill to what will be changed, (in the above example, "amend Section 23" where it says "shall be null"). 
* Give context like: 'this change shall be effective a year after enactment.'
* Give instruction where there will be nothing remaining, like: "Section 24 is repealed."

The part that is not italicized is the "law language." 
This is more intuitive: it is the language that will remain as Law.

In the example above, "shall be void" remains as a part of the law. 

Normally, those involved in the preparation and execution of Bills and Laws know how to distinguish one type of language from the other. 

But because we are working in the public sphere, we will add the convention just described of _italicizing operational language_ and leaving the law language un-italicized. 

NOTE: This legislation is in relation to Release point 119-4, which is the Internal Revenue Service Code from just prior to the second Trump Administration. This will need some tweaks to work with the tax code passed in 2025 as part of the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

==== Section 1 — Congressional declaration of purpose

. In General: By enacting this Fair and Share Tax Reform Congress intends to create a stronger society by giving every adult US Citizens a basic means to safeguard their own Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness.  

==== Section 2 — Definition of symbols and terms. 

. To mark the importance of the new social contract enacted by this Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Tax and Share, the General Services Administration is directed to introduce publicly available fonts and educational materials which explain the following symbols and terms, and to work with the Unicode Consortium to standardize a new unicode character for each of the following symbols:
..  : the Fair Tax Rate.  An Equal Tax Rate on all US Income which shall adjust according to the US Debt-to-GDP ratio;  
..  : the Target Debt-to-GDP ratio.  This amount shall be compared with actual US Debt-to-GDP to form the basis for raising or lowering the Fair Tax Rate ; 
..  : the Adjustment Rate.  This percentage slows the rise and fall of the Fair Tax Rate . As defined in Section 12, below, every year the Secretary of the Treasury shall multiply this Adjustment Rate  by the difference between the actual US Debt-to-GDP Ratio and the Target US Debt-to-GDP Ratio , then add the result — which will be positive if the Debt is over the target, but negative if the Debt is under the target — to the previous year’s Fair Tax Rate  to determine the next year’s Fair Tax Rate ;
..  : the Share Rate.  This is the percentage of one one-billionth of US Gross Real Income equivalent to $20,000 as of the first of the year of enactment, where:
... The units on the Share Rate  are n% or nano-percent, and 
... As an example, $20,000 divided by $23 Trillion US Gross Real Income, would mean The Share Rate  would be 86.957n%, and  
... This amount shall remain constant unless changed by legislation;  
..  : the Share Amount.  This is the before-tax amount of The Share, where: 
... The Share Amount  is expressed in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar, and
... The Share Amount  shall be calculated by the Secretary of the Treasury every year by multiplying the Share Rate  by the US Gross Real Income for the previous year, and 
... This amount shall be changed every year according to the definition in Section 12, and 
... This amount shall be paid in equal payments to every Share Recipient twice monthly as defined in Section 16, and 
... As an example, 
.... if the Share Rate  is 86.957n%, and the US Gross Real Income for 2030 were to be $26.5 T, then the Share Amount  for 2031 would be  $23,043, and 
.... In this example, if the Fair Tax Rate  for that year were 34%, then every adult citizen over 18 (with a few exceptions) would receive a net Share Amount  of $15,208.38 (which would be the $23,043 share minus 34% in taxes), and 
.... In this example, each Share Recipient would receive two checks every month from the IRS for one twenty fourth of the net amount, or two checks a month for $633.68.  
... US Gross Real Income is defined here as all income subject to the tax imposed by this Subchapter A.  
... US Gross Real Income may also be referred to as Gross Real Income or GRI. 
. The Secretary of Commerce shall publish the US Gross Real Income as a line item in their monthly financial reports to the nation.  

==== Section 3 — Tax imposed 

. In General — There is hereby imposed on every individual and every business in the United States an Income Tax equal to the Fair Tax Rate (  ) times the taxable income of every individual and every business, where corporations of any kind are considered a business and net revenue of any kind of a business or corporation is considered income.   
. The Fair Tax Rate Percentage (  ) is defined and maintained in this Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Sections 11 and 12.  
. Certain entities included in the Income Tax:
.. Any individual or entity that receives income derived from activities within the United States;

.. State, city, county and local governments, and their subsidiary units;
.. Charitable, philanthropic, religious, educational, cultural, non-profit, and any other organizations that qualify under Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter F.  

==== Section 4 — Determination of Taxable Income for Individuals 

. In General — Taxable income means all gross income included by Section 4 (b), and not including all income excluded by Section 4 (c) and minus any deductions allowed in Section 4 (d), as follows:  
. Except as otherwise provided in this Subtitle A, gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) the following specific items: footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (Gross Income defined)] 
.. the Share Amount ;  
.. Compensation for services and work including wages, salaries, fees, commissions, prizes, fringe benefits, bonuses, awards, tips, and any other material income or compensation for individuals employed by others or self employed; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (1) (Gross Income defined)]

Gains from dealings in real or investment property, including net gains derived from sale or exchange of property, interest received, rents received, royalties received, dividends received, annuities received; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (3)-(8), (Gross Income defined)]
.. Income from life insurance and endowment contracts; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (3)-(8) (Gross Income defined)]
.. Pensions; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (9) (Gross Income defined)]
.. Income from discharge of indebtedness, except in the case of bankruptcy; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (10) (Gross Income defined)] 
.. Distributive share of partnership gross income; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (12) (Gross Income defined)]
.. Income from inheritance or in respect of a decadent; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (13) (Gross Income defined)]
.. Income from an interest in an estate or Trust; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Section 61 (a) (14) (Gross Income defined)]
.. Cash equivalent of financial instruments conveyed to employees; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part II, Section 83 (Property transferred in connection with performance of services)]
.. Government benefits not otherwise exempted; footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part II, Section 85 (Unemployment compensation), is one example]
.. 50% of: footnote:[Originally from Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part II, Section 86 (Social Security and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement Benefits) creates a progressive scale that uses a 50% rule for the taxable base of Social Security Benefits (SSB) and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement Benefits (RRB), but slides that to 0% for those with a benefit under $25,000 (individual) and 85% for those with a benefit over $34,000.  This effectively makes a variable tax rate, not an equal, fair tax rate, which this proposal claims is unfair.  However, because by definition people on SSB or RRB are dealing with the difficulties of old age and end of life, we as a society have over generations afforded them a lower rate of taxation through this section of the tax code.  Therefore, this proposal continues that by fixing the 50% reduction to income from SSB/RRB. For those who used to enjoy the 0% rate, the Share Amount  more than makes up for the tax on that income.  ]
... Social Security payments;  
... Tier 1 Railroad Retirement Benefits;  
.. Gifts in excess of the amount of The Share Amount  in effect on the date of the gift;  
.. Tax Grant receipts which are taxable as defined by the Tax Grant legislation;  
.. Unusual sources of income including: legal settlements;  income determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be taxable;  and the market value of long-term housing provided by an employer;  
.. Remuneration for services performed outside the United States unless such remuneration is either taxed by another country, or exempted from taxable income under Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter N;  
.. Any other items of positive income described in Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part I, Sections 64 and 66;
.. Any other items of positive income described in Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part II, Sections 72-91;  
. Specific Items Excluded from Taxable Income: 
.. In General — This section defined the kinds of income which are sufficiently integrated with expenses or taxed in other ways, or explicitly excluded from taxation, and which therefore shall be excluded from Taxable Income; 
.. Also In General — Deductions may be allowed from the following list of sections within Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter B subject to the limitation that any duplicate items may be deducted from income only once and only using the smallest amount defined:

==== Section 6 — Determination of Tax Amount for Individuals

. In general — Tax Credits for Individuals shall only be allowed if they are listed in the following Subparts of Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part IV (Credits Against Tax):
.. Subpart A (Nonrefundable Personal Credits), and 
.. Subpart B (Other Credits), and 
.. Subpart C (Refundable Credits);
. Where Tax Credits specify amounts for individuals, or heads of household, or married persons filing jointly, or married persons filing separately, taxpayers shall be due the maximum Tax Credit defined under the assumption that a married couple can be divided into two equal individuals.xviii  
.. For example, if a Disability Tax Credit lists a maximum benefit of $5,000 for a single disabled individual in a household, but $7,500 in the case of a joint return for two disabled spouses, or $3,750 for a disabled married person filing separately, then the Tax Credit authorized by this Section would be $5,000 for each individual. Therefore a married couple where where both are disabled and filing jointly would have a $10,000 Tax Credit, if each filed separately they would each receive a $5,000 Tax Credit, and if one was disabled and filed separately, the disabled spouse would receive a $5,000 Tax Credit. 
.. For a further example, if an IRA Tax Credit allowed a $1,000 Tax Credit for a joint return of married persons, but a $1,500 Tax Credit if the spouse filed a single return as a head of household, then the Tax Credit authorized by this Section would allow $1,500 for the spouse whether they file a joint return or a single return.  If both spouses would have qualified for $1,500 if either had filed as head of household, then they may file a joint return with a $3,000 Tax Credit or two separate returns with each receiving a $1,500 Tax Credit.  
.. Each Tax Credit shall be evaluated using a different method of resolving language that designates different benefits for different classes of the benefit to an individual if language of 
. In general: Individuals shall owe a tax calculated as follows:  
.. Determine the individual’s net taxable income using the rules of Section 4, then 
.. Multiply that net taxable income by The Fair Tax Rate  to get the individual’s initial tax burden, then 
.. Subtract any tax credits for which the individual qualifies from their tax burden to get their final tax;
. Tax Credits are specified in the following Subparts of Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part IV: 
.. Subpart A (Nonrefundable Personal Credits), and 
.. Subpart B (Other Credits), and 
.. Subpart C (Refundable Credits);
. If on [Effective Date] the individual taxpayer has an unused tax credit balance from previous tax years,  the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer shall be reduced by applying the amount of their unused tax credit.  If unused tax credits still exists, then the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer shall be reduced for each successive year by applying remaining unused tax credit amounts until unused tax credits are exhausted.  

==== Section 7 — Determination of Tax Amount for Businesses

. In general: Businesses will owe a tax equal to the The Fair Tax Rate  times their taxable income, as determined by Subtitle A, Subchapter A, Section 5.  
. If on the first of the year following enactment of the Fair and Share Tax Act a business taxpayer has an unused tax credit balance from previous tax years,  the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer shall be reduced by applying the amount of their unused tax credit.  If unused tax credits still exists, then the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer shall be reduced for each successive year by applying remaining unused tax credit amounts until unused tax credits are exhausted.  

==== Section 8 — Withholding

. In general — The taxes imposed on Individuals shall be collected by the employer of the taxpayer by deducting the amount of the tax from the wages as and when paid.  
. Special rules for tips — 
.. In the case of tips which constitute wages, subsection (a) shall be applicable only to such tips as are included in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), and only to the extent that collection can be made by the employer, at or after the time such statement is so furnished and before the close of the 10th day following the calendar month (or, if paragraph (3) applies, the 30th day following the year) in which the tips were deemed paid, by deducting the amount of the tax from such wages of the employee (excluding tips, but including funds turned over by the employee to the employer pursuant to paragraph (2)) as are under control of the employer. 
.. If the tax imposed by section 3, with respect to tips which are included in written statements furnished in any month to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), exceeds the wages of the employee (excluding tips) from which the employer is required to collect the tax under paragraph (b) (1) of this section, the employee may furnish to the employer on or before the 10th day of the following month (or, if paragraph (b) (3) applies, on or before the 30th day of the following year) an amount of money equal to the amount of the excess. 
.. The Secretary of the Treasury may, under regulations prescribed by him, authorize employers—
... to estimate the amount of tips that will be reported by the employee pursuant to section 6053(a) in any calendar year;  
... to determine the amount to be deducted upon each payment of wages (exclusive of tips) during such year as if the tips so estimated constituted the actual tips so reported; and  
... to deduct upon any payment of wages (other than tips, but including funds turned over by the employee to the employer pursuant to paragraph (b) (2)) to such employee during such year (and within 30 days thereafter) such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount actually deducted upon such wages of the employee during the year to the amount required to be deducted in respect of tips included in written statements furnished to the employer during the year.  
.. If the tax imposed by section 3 with respect to tips which constitute wages exceeds the portion of such tax which can be collected by the employer from the wages of the employee pursuant to paragraph (b) (1) or paragraph (b) (3), such excess shall be paid by the employee.  
. Indemnification of Employer — Every employer required so to deduct the tax imposed by section 3 shall be liable for the payment of such tax, and shall be indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any such payment made by such employer.  
. To the extent that any tax imposed by section 3 is not collected by the employer, such tax shall be paid by the employee.  
. If an employer, in violation of this chapter, fails to deduct and withhold the tax imposed by section 3 and thereafter the tax is paid by the employee, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer, but this paragraph shall in no case relieve the employer from liability for any penalties or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold.  

==== Section 9 — Conversion of Payroll Taxes to Wages

. In general — Beginning on the first day of the calendar year after Enactment, there will be a one-time conversion of employer’s obligation to pay ‘Payroll Taxes’ into wages.  ‘Payroll Taxes’ were formerly authorized under Subtitle C, Chapter 21, Subchapter B, ‘Tax on Employers,’ which is now repealed.  This requirement means employers must convert sums equivalent to 7.65% of employee remuneration into additional wage payments to their employees.  
. Such payments to employees replace the obligation under the now repealed Subtitle C, Chapter 21, Subchapter B, Tax on Employers, which means no additional burden for employers, but also no windfall from repeal of Subtitle C, Chapter 21, Subchapter B.   
. Such payments to employees may be made on a pay schedule no less frequent than the tax withholding depository schedule formerly imposed on the employer by the Secretary of the Treasury.  
. Special rules for tips — in the case of employers of taxpayers for whom tips constitute wages, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide a percentage of hourly non-tip wages which employers must convert to paid wages in order to compensate employees for the amount formerly paid by the employer to the Secretary as ‘Payroll Taxes.’  The Secretary may make this conversion percentage applicable generally or specifically at the Secretary’s discretion. The Secretary shall make this conversion available a number available at least one month before the beginning of the calendar year following Enactment.  

==== Section 10 — Designation of taxation amounts for Trust Funds

. In general — The amount of tax which shall be directed to the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare are as follows: 
.. Funds directed to the “Federal Old-Age and Survivor’s Insurance Trust Fund” are 12.4% of Taxable Income;  
.. Funds directed to the “Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund,” are 2.9% of taxable income.  
 . The Secretary shall create “The Share Trust Fund” which shall be used to make the Share payments as described in Section 16 of this Title. 
 . The Secretary must deposit funds from tax revenues into the The Share Trust Fund monthly on a schedule designed by the Secretary to maintain The Share Trust Fund with sufficient funds to pay The Share Amount to all eligible Share Recipients for three month.   

==== Section 11 — Initial Fair Tax Rate Upon Enactment 

. Upon Enactment, the Fair Tax Rate  for the following two tax-years, shall be 34%.  
. At the beginning of the third tax-year after Enactment, the Tax Rate  will vary according to economic conditions as defined in the following Section 12.  

==== Section 12 — Adjustment of the Fair Tax Rate

. In general: The Fair Tax Rate  will vary according to this formula:  
.. Perform the following steps: 
... Subtract the Target Debt-to-GDP-Ratio  from the previous government fiscal year’s actual Debt-to-GDP-Ratio: this will give a positive or negative percentage number, then 
... Multiply that number by the Adjustment Rate , this will be a smaller percentage number, then
... Add the resulting percentage to the Fair Tax Rate  for the previous calendar year.
... The result is the new Fair Tax Rate  for the next calendar year. 
.. Where:  
... The US Debt-to-GDP-Ratio shall include both privately held debt and intergovernmental debt for the previous government fiscal year;  
... The GDP used for the Debt-to-GDP ratio will be for the matching previous year;  
... The Target Debt-to GDP  = 100%;  
... The Adjustment Rate  = 3%.  
.. For example, if GDP to Debt ratio on year 2 after [Enactment year] was 110%, then the new adjusted Fair Tax Rate  for year 3 would be 34% plus 3% of 10%, which is 34% plus 0.3%, which is 34.3%.  Likewise, if GDP to Debt ratio on year 10 is 95%, and the Fair Tax Rate  for year 10 was 31%, then the Fair Tax Rate  for year 11 would be 31% minus 3% of 5%, which is 31% minus 0.15%, which is 30.85%.  
. Beginning with the third year after Enactment, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish the new Fair Tax Rate as soon as practicable, but no later than one quarter before the beginning of every new tax year, using the formula described in this Section 12 (a).  

==== Section 13 — Exceptions to the Fair Tax Rate

. In general: If any other section of this Title 26 specifies a tax rate on income lower than the  Fair Tax Rate  specified here in Chapter A, Subchapter A, Sections 11 and 12, or if any other law has such an effect, then that tax rate shall be raised to the Fair Tax Rate .  
. Another section of this Title 26 may specifically refer to this Section 13 (b) and specify a Tax Rate lower than the Fair Tax Rate , subject to to the super-majority provision in the following Section 14.  

==== Section 14 — Super-Majority required to make Exceptions to the Fair Tax Rate 

. In General.--It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, simple resolution, amendment thereto, or conference report thereon that includes any provision that--
.. Uses an Exception under Section 13(b) to decrease any Income Tax rate below the Fair Tax Rate ;  
.. Creates any class of Income for Individuals or Businesses (including Corporations) that is not subject to the Fair Tax Rate ;  
.. Alters the calculation of the Fair Tax Rate ;  
.. Alters the value of the Debt-to-GDP Target ;  
.. Alters the value of the Adjustment Rate ;  
.. Provides any exclusion, deduction, credit or other benefit which results in reduction in Federal revenues;  
. Waiver or Suspension.--This section 14 may be waived or suspended in the House of Representatives or the Senate only by the affirmative vote of six-tenths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.

Sec.
"15.	Determination of Share Amount."

==== Section 15 — Determination of Share Amount

. Upon Enactment, the Secretary of the Treasury will determine the fixed Share Percentage  as follows:  
.. Divide the sum of $20,000 by the US Gross Real Income and publish this ratio as the Share Percentage  in nano-percent, or n%.  
.. The US Gross Real Income shall be for a period of twelve (12) months beginning two months before the Date of Enactment.  
.. The US Gross Real Income shall be defined as all incomes subject to the Fair Tax as legislated under Subchapter A, which is also the amount directed to be published by the Secretary of Commerce under Section 2 (b) of this Subtitle A.  
. The Secretary shall publish the new Share Amount  for each year as follows: 
.. The Share Amount is The Share Percentage  multiplied by US Gross Real Income for the previous year, rounded to the nearest dollar.  
.. The initial Share Amount  shall be $20,000 because the Secretary shall use the same twelve (12) month period of US Gross Real Income to determine both The Share Percentage  and The Share Amount .  
.. The initial Share Amount 0 shall be used until the beginning of the second full calendar year after [Date of Enactment].  
.. Beginning on the first of November on the calendar year after [Date of Enactment], the Secretary shall determine and publish The Share Amount  for the upcoming calendar year by multiplying The Share Percentage  times the US Gross Real Income from the previous US Fiscal year (October through September).  

==== Section 16 — Payment of the Share Amount

. In General — All citizens of the US who are over 18 years of age are eligible to receive The Share  beginning the first of the month after they turn 18.

.. One twenty-fourth payment will be made on the first of the month;  
.. One twenty-fourth payment will be made on the fifteenth of the month;  
.. Payment will be made to US citizens wherever they reside, in a manner designed to prioritize both security and convenience, but with security most important;  
.. Taxes on The Share Payment will be withheld by the IRS and accrue to satisfy the tax burden imposed on the Share Recipient;  
.. If the Secretary determines payments have been made in error, correction will be subject to the following: 
... If an under-payment has been made, then the Secretary shall disburse a lump payment for any and all under-payments, plus interest equal to the 3-month Treasury rate  based on the average market yield (during any 1-month period selected by the Secretary and ending in the calendar month in which the determination is made) on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity of 3 months or less, and
... If an over-payment has been made due to a mistake by the Secretary, then no penalty may be added to any Share Recipient, and  
... Any over-payment of an amount less than 20% greater than the correct amount shall be forgiven by the Secretary, and  
... Any over-payment of an amount greater than 20% may be recovered at the Secretary’s discretion according to the following:  
.... if the over-payment is between 20% and 100%, then the Share Recipient’s future Share checks shall be garnished at a rate of no more than 5%  until the amount of over-payment is recovered,  
.... if the over-payment is over 100%, then the Secretary may attempt to recover the amount from the Share Recipient’s currency assets, and failing such recovery may garnish future Share checks at a rate of no more than 10% until the amount of over-payment is recovered;  
.. If the Secretary cannot determine a means to distribute a Share payment to a Share Recipient’s control, then the Secretary shall hold all such payments in trust in a manner determined by the Secretary, subject to the following:  
... The Secretary will exert all due effort to find a means to disburse unpaid Share amounts to eligible recipients;  
... Share amounts held in trust shall accumulate interest in a manner determined by the Secretary to best reflect the interest paid on US debt;  
... If the recipient is being held by a foreign power, the Secretary shall hold in trust all Share payments until the freedom or death of the Share Recipient;  
... If the recipient is being held to account for crimes in the United States, or in any of the States, the Secretary shall hold in trust all Share payments until the freedom or death of the Share Recipient;  
... If the recipient is being held illegally in the United States, or in any of the States, or in a foreign country, the Secretary shall hold in trust all Share payments until the freedom death of the Share Recipient;  
... If the Secretary determines a Share Recipient has died, then the Secretary will hold any of that Share recipient’s funds that are held in trust for a period of five years during which any other claims against such funds may be granted by the Secretary or by a court of competent jurisdiction by using the following guidance:  
.... In General — Share payments are meant to benefit a living Share Recipient as part of a social contract that maintains all adult US Citizens have intrinsic value and that as such no one should have too little;  and 
.... Share payments are not meant to benefit adult survivors of Share recipients;  and 
.... Share payments are not transferable assets;  and 
.... Some circumstances may exist, such as dependent children with no other Share recipient guardians for whom receiving Share funds held in trust may be deemed appropriate;  or mistakes relating to Share payments made by either the government or by Share Recipients which can be rectified by disbursement of Share funds after death;  or other circumstances where the Conscience of the Secretary or the Conscience of the Court deems it appropriate to disburse Share funds held in trust after the death of a Share Recipient.  
.. No deduction may be made from any Share payment or any payments held in trust except as follows:  
... Government may pre-enroll individual Share recipients in a government health care plan so long as:  
.... The benefits of such payment accrues to the individual Share recipient;  and  
.... The Share recipient has the option to un-enroll in such payments at any time;  
... Government may not pre-enroll Share recipients in any other government payment plan;.
... Share recipients may elect to have the government automatically deduct amounts from their Share and direct payment to other recipients, including the government, so long as:  
.... The Secretary has made arrangements for Share recipients to make election for such payments; and  
.... Such payments accrue to the benefit of the individual Share recipient;  and  
.... The Share recipient has the option to un-enroll in such payments at any time;  
... A court of competent jurisdiction may garnish Share payments so long as:  
.... Share recipient has exhausted due process steps to resist such garnishment; and  
.... An annual review process exists to challenge such garnishment in the future; and  
.... The IRS has a process to lapse such garnishment if an annual review process requirement has not been met.

. _Repeals.--The following subchapters of Subtitle A, Chapter 1 and the items relating to such subchapters in the table of subchapters for such chapter 1 are repealed:_
.. _Subchapter A: Part IV, Subpart D, Section 45B (Credit for portion of employer social security taxes paid with respect to employee cash tips is repealed as irrelevant after elimination of the Payroll Tax by this bill)_ footnote:[This “Payroll Tax” is eliminated by this proposal, so employers will no longer be paying it, therefore there is no need for a subsidy.]

.. _Subchapter B: Part I, Section 67 (2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions)_ footnote:[Section 67 disallows certain deductions unless they amount to more than 2% of income.

.. _Subchapter B: Part I, Section 68 (Overall limitation of itemized deductions)_ footnote:[Section 68 reduces the amount of deductions high-earning people may claim based on the amount of their income.

In the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the timeframe for this zeroing of the tax exemption was changed to all of time following December 31, 2017. For simplicity, this entire section should be removed from the tax code altogether.]
