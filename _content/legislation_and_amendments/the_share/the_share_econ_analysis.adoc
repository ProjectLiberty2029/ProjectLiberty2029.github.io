== Overview

This page is a stub. 

There is a great deal of analysis to upload and to link to. 
That work will be completed shortly. 

It includes:
. White papers on the success of Flat Tax systems.
. White papers on the projected GDP growth and inflation of various Universal Basic Incomes, including a good match to The Share: nearly the same monthly payment and paid for as-you-go. 
. Various studies that have confirmed the sensible answer that when you give people money, they generally use it to improve their lives (just as you reading this would do). 
. Spreadsheets and charts that use the projections to predict the future for 100 years to insure the variable tax rate î€¡ does in fact stabilize in the 34% range (about where it starts).
. Spreadsheets and charts that show why we predict 80% of Americans do better under this plan.
