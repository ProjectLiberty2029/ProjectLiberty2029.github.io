= Overview

This is a sample of the main things you will want in your page. 
You can cut and paste from inside this document to do most things.

== Front matter

All Asciidocs must start with an = followed by the Document Title. 
In this document, that looks like "= A Sample Document to Copy and Modify"

The very next line begins a bunch of special words that are in the form of :showtitle: or :page-authors: and so forth. These are called *document attributes.*

All the documents in this project should have at least the document attributes included with this document with one exception. 
That exception is the :showtitle: attribute: it is a personal preference whether you want it to display at the top of your pages. 
However, because the '= Document Title' _is still required,_ it will always display on the Wiki homepage.

Here are the other document attributes and what they do for us:

. Static-do not change or it will break something:
.. :doctype: book This is needed to insure the formatting works as expected. 
.. :table-caption: Data Set …​ This allows the pages to display captions on tables.
.. :imagesdir: /content/media/images/ …​ This allows the website to find any images we are hosting. It also tells you where to put images you wish to add. You can add sub-directories for images and you’ll find examples of that in this document.
.. :page-liquid: This allows you to use the page variables in your document's front matter: things like "{% raw %}{{ page.authors }}{% endraw %} would like to thank subscribers," becomes "{{ page.authors }} would like to thank subscribers." 
. Things you are meant to change:
. :page-draft_complete: Valid values are 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% and link:/content/Page_Draft_Status.html[are defined here.] This status appears in the upper left-hand corner of the page when displayed on a computer. Phones do not display this panel, unless you switch to desktop mode. If you do not want this block to appear on your document, put "NoShow" there. 
. :page-stage: Valid values are 0 through 12 and link:/content/Stages_Defined.html[are described here.] These stages will cause
the document to automatically appear in the "Staged Needs" section of the index page. If your document should have a stage but not appear (like this document,) put NoShow here. 
. :page-authors: Here you can let us know who you are so the community knows who ask questions. This can be any text, and you can leave it blank. If included, this displays in the left-hand pane under the table of contents. Phones do not display this panel, unless you switch to desktop mode. Please do not put personal identifiable information here other than your real name (if you want to) because this information will be everywhere on the internet. 
.. :page-todos: Here you can type any text to indicate the next steps needed for your document. It appears in the left hand pane under the author name. 
.. :showtitle: If this attribute is present, the document title displays at the top. If you remove it, the document title will not display on the page, but the homepage will still show the document title in the clickable list of all documents.

== Headers Requirements

The more == you use, the higher the header number. 

The first line of the document also has an =, but this indicates the title. 

You can't have two First level Headers (a single =) following each other.

You have to put a space after the header line for it to appear as a header. 

You have to have at least one == Header in every document. 

== General Formatting

Text can be *bold*, _italic_, or [.line-through]#strikethrough#.

== Links and footnotes and variables

This is a link to <<070_faq.adoc#,FAQs>> which is in the same folder with this document. 
This link opens in the same tab.

This is a link to <</content/page_draft_status.adoc#,Page Draft Status>> which is in a different folder. 
This link opens in the same tab.

This is a link to link:https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/["the 12th Amendment to the US Constitution.", window=read-later,opts="noopener,nofollow"] 
This link opens in a new tab.

This is a footnote with link text. footnote:[This footnote links to the link:https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/["12th Amendment to the US Constitution", window=read-later,opts="noopener,nofollow"]] 

This is a footnote with just plain text. footnote:[This footnote only tells us something detailed. ] 

This is a document variable that you can make display: this page was written by {{ page-authors }}. 
Any of the front-matter attributes can be put between double curly brackets and the variables will then display. 

== Tax Glyphs

If you want to write documents that refer to "The Share," or "Fair and Share Tax," then the special symbols are here:
(These will appear as just blocks in the GitHub Web interface, and may also appear that way in text editors if you have not installed and configured them to use a Share-font that has these characters. 
But if you copy them from here and insert them into a document, when it is published on the Wiki, it will appear.)

   Tax Rate (a regular percent) +
   Debt Target (a ratio of Debt/GDP) +
   Adjustment Rate (a regular percentage) +
   Share Percentage (a regular percentage that will be divided by one-billion) +
   Share Amount (in dollars) +
   Wealth Tax Rate (a regular percentage) +
   Wealth Gap Target (a regular number, which is a multiplier of median wealth to get a wealth target) +

== How to make comments:

What follows is a comment that does not appear: (This is done by
beginning a line with two // )

What follows is a block of lines that do not appear. (This is done with
four //// at the beginning of the first line and at the beginning of the
line after the last block-comment.)

== Note! Admonitions!

There are five words that you can substitute in the following examples to draw attention to text. 

NOTE: (This is a Note) Lincoln said ballots are stronger than bullets.

TIP: (This is a Tip) Voting early can help your side save money by removing you from the call list. 

IMPORTANT: (This is Important) Voting at all is better than not voting.

CAUTION: (This is a Caution) Bots are spreading the message that voting won't matter. 

WARNING: (This is a Warning) Lines can be long at polling places. 

A more complicated block:

.Feeding Oligarchs

While Oligarchs are already full, they can consume infinite amounts of resources. +
They use many techniques to make this possible:

* Corporate structures
* Political influence

== Tables

This is a table:

.Data Set 1. Mmm good things
[width="100%",cols="25%,50%,25%",options="header",]

== A Horizontal Rule

There are three ways to make horizontal lines. 
Each method is used once below this text.

== Images: 

Note that the :imagesdir: document attribute at the beginning of this document makes Jekyll and asciidoc look in that directory fo the image. 
So you only need to provide the pathname starting from within the _content/Media/Images/ directory. 
Also note: the actual directory on disk is "_content" but it is labeled "content" because the Jekyll software removes the underscore in creating the website. 

Default size from the root directory: (note that you need a blank after this text or the image will not display)

image::by-sa.png[CC BY-SA, alt = "The Deed Shield"]

Default size from a sub-directory:

image::icons/shareonblur150.png[Share Icon, alt="The Share Icon"]

Override size:

image::icons/shareonblur150.png[Share Icon, alt="The Share Icon" width=100, height = 100]

Caption:

image::by-sa.png[CC BY-SA, the Deed Icon, width=200,height=100, title="This is the BY-SA 4.0 Deed Shield"] 

Image to the right of text:

== Embedding Other Media

To embed media from a source like YouTube or Spotify, get embed code from that platform (usually available somewhere in the "Share" options).

In the document, where you want it to appear, put two sets of four plus marks, ++++ with a blank line before and after both lines. 

See <</content/phase_x_misc/lyrics/010_battle_hymn_for_fair_and_share.adoc#,Lyrics for Battle Hymn for Fair and Share>> for an example of embedding a Spotify song. 

== Definition lists

Asciidoc syntax:

Name::
  Godzilla
Born::
  1952
Birthplace::
  Japan
Color::
  Green
