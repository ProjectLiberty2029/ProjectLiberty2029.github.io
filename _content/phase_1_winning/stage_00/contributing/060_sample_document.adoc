= Overview

This is a sample of the main things you will want in your page. 
You can cut and paste from inside this document to do most things.

== Front matter

All Asciidocs must start with an = followed by the Document Title. 
In this document, that looks like "= A Sample Document to Copy and Modify"

The very next line begins a bunch of special words that are in the form of :showtitle: or :page-authors: and so forth. These are called *document attributes.*

All the documents in this project should have at least the document attributes included with this document with one exception. 
That exception is the :showtitle: attribute: it is a personal preference whether you want it to display at the top of your pages. 
However, because the '= Document Title' _is still required,_ it will always display on the Wiki homepage.

Here are the other document attributes and what they do for us:

. *Static*-do not change or it will break something:
.. :doctype: book This is needed to insure the formatting works as expected. 
.. :table-caption: Data Set …​ This allows the pages to display captions on tables.
.. :imagesdir: /content/media/images/ …​ This allows the website to find any images we are hosting. It also tells you where to put images you wish to add. You can add sub-directories for images and you’ll find examples of that in this document.
.. :page-liquid: This allows you to use the page variables in your document's front matter: things like "{% raw %}{{ page.authors }}{% endraw %} would like to thank subscribers," becomes "{{ page.authors }} would like to thank subscribers." 
. *Customize*-things you are meant to change:
.. :page-draft_complete: Valid values are 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% and <</content/Page_Draft_Status.adoc#,are defined here.>> This status appears in the upper left-hand corner of the page when displayed on a computer. Phones do not display this panel, unless you switch to desktop mode. If you do not want this block to appear on your document, put "NoShow" there. 
.. :page-stage: Valid values are 0 through 12 and <</content/phase_1_winning/stage_00/stg00_030_stages_defined.adoc#,are described here.>> These stages will cause
the document to automatically appear in the "Staged Needs" section of the index page. If your document should have a stage but not appear (like this document,) put NoShow here. 
.. :page-authors: Here you can let us know who you are so the community knows who ask questions. This can be any text, and you can leave it blank. If included, this displays in the left-hand pane under the table of contents. Phones do not display this panel, unless you switch to desktop mode. Please do not put personal identifiable information here other than your real name (if you want to) because this information will be everywhere on the internet. 
.. :page-todos: Here you can type any text to indicate the next steps needed for your document. It appears in the left hand pane under the author name. 
. *Optional*- including or excluding will change your page layout
.. :showtitle: If this attribute is present, the document title displays at the top. If you remove it, the document title will not display on the page, but the homepage will still show the document title in the clickable list of all documents.
.. ":page-custom_nesting: law-nesting"  If this element is there (do not include the quotes) then the document will have the nested order listing behavior of Federal Legislation (ie, (a) (1) (A) (i)) 

== Headers Requirements

The more == you use, the higher the header number. 

The first line of the document also has an =, but this indicates the title. 

You can't have more than one First level Headers (a single =) following each other.

You have to put a space after the header line for it to appear as a header. 

You have to have at least one == Header in every document. 

Generally, we make the documents with the Title using the = on the first line, and all other headers start at two (==).

== General Formatting

Text can be *bold*, _italic_, or [.line-through]#strikethrough#.

You can indent a line like this:

[.indent]
This line is indented. 

You can indent several lines, you can do it like this: 

[.indent]
This line is indented. +
This line is also indented. 

If you want to set a paragraph against a white backdrop, you can do it like this: 

====
This seems separate, but not as separate as if you are using an <<Admonition,Admonition block.>>
Note that the target of that # tag for "Admonition" tag is formatted like this: "[#Admonition]"
====

If you want to force a line break in normal text, you can use a "+" at the end of the line: 

This line goes to here +
then continues on the next line. 

If you want to force a line break and that "+" isn't working, it's because your text is in some other context like a code block or a table. In that case, use [%hardbreaks] before the lines of text. A blank line will stop the effect of the [%hardbreaks]

[%hardbreaks]
This is on line one
and this is on line two.

But this is on line one
and this is also on line one.


== Links and footnotes and variables

This is a link to <<070_faq.adoc#,FAQs>> which is in the same folder with this document. 
This link opens in the same tab.

This is a link to <</content/page_draft_status.adoc#,Page Draft Status>> which is in a different folder. 
This link opens in the same tab.

This is a link to link:https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/["the 12th Amendment to the US Constitution.", window=read-later,opts="noopener,nofollow"] 
This link opens in a new tab.

This is a footnote with link text. footnote:[This footnote links to the link:https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/["12th Amendment to the US Constitution", window=read-later,opts="noopener,nofollow"]] 

Note that the last part of the link that reads: , window=read-later,opts="noopener,nofollow" is important to open the resource in a new tab and to do so securely. 

This is a footnote with just plain text. footnote:[This footnote only tells us something detailed. ] 

This is a document variable that you can make display: this page was written by {{ page-authors }}. 
Any of the front-matter attributes can be put between double curly brackets and the variables will then display. 

You can jump to a point in the same document <<Admonition,like this.>>
Note that the target of that # tag for "Admonition" tag is formatted like this: "[#Admonition]"

== Tax Glyphs

If you want to write documents that refer to "The Share," or "Fair and Share Tax," then the special symbols are here:
(These will appear as just blocks in the GitHub Web interface, and may also appear that way in text editors if you have not installed and configured them to use a Share-font that has these characters. 
But if you copy them from here and insert them into a document, when it is published on the Wiki, it will appear.)

   Tax Rate (a regular percent) +
   Debt Target (a ratio of Debt/GDP) +
   Adjustment Rate (a regular percentage) +
   Share Percentage (a regular percentage that will be divided by one-billion) +
   Share Amount (in dollars) +
   Wealth Tax Rate (a regular percentage) +
   Wealth Gap Target (a regular number, which is a multiplier of median wealth to get a wealth target) +

== How to make comments:

What follows is a comment that does not appear: (This is done by
beginning a line with two // )

What follows is a block of lines that do not appear. (This is done with
four //// at the beginning of the first line and at the beginning of the
line after the last block-comment.)

[#Admonition]
== Note! Admonitions!

There are five words that you can substitute in the following examples to draw attention to text. 

NOTE: (This is a Note) Lincoln said ballots are stronger than bullets.

TIP: (This is a Tip) Voting early can help your side save money by removing you from the call list. 

IMPORTANT: (This is Important) Voting at all is better than not voting.

CAUTION: (This is a Caution) Bots are spreading the message that voting won't matter. 

WARNING: (This is a Warning) Lines can be long at polling places. 

A more complicated block:

[IMPORTANT]
.Feeding Oligarchs
====
While Oligarchs are already full, they can consume infinite amounts of resources. +
They use many techniques to make this possible:

* Corporate structures
* Political influence
====

If you just want to separate text by putting it into a block without the big admonition, 
you can use four ==== before and after like this:

====
[%hardbreaks]
This text gets put into what is called a "code block," but without other syntax 
(not relevant to legislation, but you can look it up) 
it doesn't get formatted with fixed-space/mono-space text. 
====

== Lists: Unordered

* A Item on an unordered list
* C Item on an unordered list
* B Item on an unordered list

== Lists: Ordered

. Item on an ordered list
. Item on an ordered list
. Item on an ordered list

== Lists: Indented

. Item on an ordered and indented list
.. Sub-item on that list
... Further Sub-item on that list
... and another
.. And back to the first sub-list
. Then the highest order of the list
. Still at the high order of the list. 

== Tables

This is a table with a caption at the top:

.Data Set 1. Mmm good things
[width="50%",cols="50%,35%,15%",options="header",]
|===
|Head1 |Heading number two |Col 3
|good sweedish fish | ok | nice
|good and plenty | out of stock | nice
|good [.red]#oreos# | ok |hmm
|good [.yellow-background]#zoute# drop | ok | yumm
|===

This is that table without the caption:

[width="50%",cols="50%,35%,15%",options="header",]
|===
|Head1 |Heading number two |Col 3
|good sweedish fish | ok | nice
|good and plenty | out of stock | nice
|good [.red]#oreos# | ok |hmm
|good [.yellow-background]#zoute# drop | ok | yumm
|===

This is that table without the bold column headings, and narrower:

[width="25%",cols="50%,35%,15%"]
|===
|good sweedish fish | ok | nice
|good and plenty | out of stock | nice
|good [.red]#oreos# | ok |hmm
|good [.yellow-background]#zoute# drop | ok | yumm
|===


== A Horizontal Rule

There are three ways to make horizontal lines. 
Each method is used once below this text.

== Images: 

Note that the :imagesdir: document attribute at the beginning of this document makes Jekyll and asciidoc look in that directory fo the image. 
So you only need to provide the pathname starting from within the _content/Media/Images/ directory. 
Also note: the actual directory on disk is "_content" but it is labeled "content" because the Jekyll software removes the underscore in creating the website. 

Default size from the root directory: (note that you need a blank after this text or the image will not display)

image::by-sa.png[CC BY-SA, alt = "The Deed Shield"]

Default size from a sub-directory:

image::icons/shareonblur150.png[Share Icon, alt="The Share Icon"]

Override size:

image::icons/shareonblur150.png[Share Icon, alt="The Share Icon" width=100, height = 100]

Caption:

image::by-sa.png[CC BY-SA, the Deed Icon, width=200,height=100, title="This is the BY-SA 4.0 Deed Shield"] 

Image to the right of text:

== Embedding Other Media

To embed media from a source like YouTube or Spotify, get embed code from that platform (usually available somewhere in the "Share" options).

In the document, where you want it to appear, put two sets of four plus marks, ++++ with a blank line before and after both lines. 

See <</content/misc_docs/lyrics/010_battle_hymn_for_fair_and_share.adoc#,Lyrics for Battle Hymn for Fair and Share>> for an example of embedding a Spotify song. 

== Definition lists

Asciidoc syntax:

Name::
  Godzilla
Born::
  1952
Birthplace::
  Japan
Color::
  Green
